                <img src='p1.jpg' alt='' onclick='imageView("p1.jpg"," This is, perhaps more than anything, the biggest showpiece for what the Nintendo Switch can do. Breath of the Wild takes ideas originally introduced in the first Legend of Zelda game along with concepts expanded on by Skyrim and other modern open-world RPGs and Nintendoizes them, distilling them into purest parts, and polishes the hell out of them. Its a world of wonder, and for the first time what feels like ages, it actually lets you experience that wonder without beating you over the head with hours of tutorials and incessant text boxes re-explaining everything you already know. Playing it on the TV is a treat, but being able to lift the Switch from the dock and take a game of this size and scope wherever you want is a perfect summation of the Switch potential.");'>

With a whopping 74 characters available to unlock, this is definitely the busiest roster of them all. That total includes 11 brand new characters - and that&#39;s before you&#39;ve even started on the DLC. That means a whole new set of fighters to learn in the heat of battle, but thankfully this is the best Super Smash Bros. title yet, both in terms of its glorious good looks, but also in the way the stages are detailed and animated, fighters move much more naturally and with additional flare, and the KO animations are more satisfying than ever. Plus, there is even a surprisingly meaty single-player story to dive into. This is quite the package. ");'>

It again sees you teaming up with your fellow inklings – that&#39;s half squid, half human – to try and paint the most of the map your team&#39;s colour in the multiplayer. It&#39;s easy to pick up and play, and although it doesn&#39;t feel totally fresh anymore as it&#39;s a sequel, it&#39;s still a refreshing take on the traditional shooter. There is also a robust single-player Hero Mode and a new Horde-esque mode known as Salmon Rush that is dangerously addictive and devilishly difficult on the highest levels.");'>

                    <img src='p4.jpg' alt='' onclick='imageView("p4.jpg","Overcooked is not an easy game to complete. You might be able to limp through the game by settling for 1-star scores occasionally, but the world map actually has some fairly demanding star requirements later on in the game. It is a major risk point for newer gamers. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that many levels make it extremely difficult for one player to carry the team to two or three stars. Because of this co-dependency I recommend not throwing a brand-spanking-new player in the proverbial gaming fire. Overcooked is best suited as the second or third game in your players gaming journey. Ideally they should be able to intuitively know where each button on the controller is without looking, and have some experience using a joystick to move around. While it is possible to start a player off on Overcooked, the games difficulty does ramp up fairly quickly. ");'>

                    <img src='p5.jpg' alt='' onclick='imageView("p5.jpg"," I give my utmost respect to Monolith for creating the prettiest game I have ever played. Uraya, a Titan you visit in the game has this massive glowing waterfall area filled with gorgeous creatures that just make you want to stare at it for days. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 was probably the most “open world” of a game you can get nowadays. Breath of the Wild is definitely up there since everything is connected in one world, whereas XBC2 is more like sections of the world, but it is definitely breathtaking. The game easily works well playing it on the Switch dock or as a handheld – even though I preferred on the dock, it was just as easy on the go. In short, if you’re looking for a compelling story that’ll get you hooked and too emotionally invested in the characters, go ahead and pick up Xenoblade Chronicles 2. It was worth it to me even when I had doubted the purchase so many times.");'>

Thanks to Mario&#39;s new friend Cappy, Super Mario Odyssey manages to successfully bring the series up to date by gifting Mario a ton of new moves. And by moving out of the Mushroom Kingdom, Mario feels fresh and new while still retaining every ounce of its nostalgia and retro charm - there are still ground pounds and green pipes do not worry. This is very much Mario as his best self so far, and his latest adventure looks absolutely beautiful on the Switch. ");'>

It is a rite of passage on every Nintendo console. This immediate, relatable, pick-up-and-play fun is exactly what the Switch was created for. Up to eight people can locally, letting you pretend that you&#39;re in a Nintendo lifestyle advert, and it is a novelty that two people can play anywhere using a single console. But best of all, this is the ultimate version of an already amazing game, and perhaps the most clear and brilliant example of how great the Switch could be. ");'>

What developer GameFreak has done with Let&#39;s Go is actually quite ingenious, blending together elements from the immensely popular mobile game Pokemon Go, with classic RPG features from the core series, all packaged up as a reimagining of the 1998 game, Pokemon Yellow. Sounds good right? Yes, yes it is. Never before has a Pokemon game felt quite so alive or immersive. You throw Poke Balls in the real world to catch Pokemon, using your Joy-Con or the brilliant Poke Ball Plus controller to mime the actual throw, and building a bond with your buddy Pokemon is a core part of the gameplay, just as it was with Pokemon Yellow. It&#39;s a surprising blend of old and new, which all works perfectly well and if you have any interest in the Pokemon series, this has to be on your Switch.");'>

Whereas any other game would put all of its focus onto a single protagonist, Square Enix&#39;s JRPG tells the story of eight - yes, eight - heroes, and all of their beautifully told stories are given the same gravitas, which is quite the feat. It&#39;s a wonderful collection of stories, told in a world that is inspired by JRPGs of old, particularly in terms of art style, and its combat is some of the best turned-based systems the JRPG world has to offer. If any of this intrigues you, then Octopath Traveler needs to be on your wishlist immediately. Or, preferably, under your thumbs. ");'>
